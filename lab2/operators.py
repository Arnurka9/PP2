"""
Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operators
"""


# Arithmetic: + - * / % ** // 
# Assignment: = += -= *= /= %= //= **= &= |= ^= >>= <<= :=
# Comparison: == != > < >= <= 
# Logical: and   or   not 
# Identity: is (when 2 variable equal 1 object)    is not (when 2 variable different from each other)
x = 100
y = 100
print(x is y)
#Membership: in    in not
#Bitwise: &  |  ^ (XOR)   ~ (Not)   << (Left shift)   >> (Rigth shift) 


# Operator Precedence
# it's like everything in mathematics


# ex 1 (here we use operator such like "()" - Parentheses  )
print((6 + 3) - (6 + 3))

# ex 2 
print(100 + 5 * 3)


# ex3 ("+" and "-" have the same precedence)
print(5 + 4 - 7 + 3)
